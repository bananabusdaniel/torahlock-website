      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="legal-date">Effective Date: February 22, 2026</p>

      <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Torah Lock ("we," "our," or "us") handles information when you use our iOS application.</p>
      <p>By using Torah Lock, you agree to the practices described in this policy.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We are committed to minimizing data collection.</p>
      <p>We do not collect personal information such as your name, email address, contacts, messages, or detailed device activity.</p>
      <p>The following information may be collected automatically:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>App performance data (crashes, errors) via Apple diagnostics</li>
        <li>Anonymous usage data (such as screens viewed or feature usage)</li>
        <li>Basic device information (device model, iOS version, language, region)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you provide optional information inside the app (such as location for Shabbat times or personal preferences), that information is stored locally on your device.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>2. Screen Time / Family Controls Data</h2>
      <p>If you enable app restrictions using Apple's Screen Time or Family Controls frameworks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>All restriction and monitoring functions operate locally on your device</li>
        <li>Torah Lock does not collect, transmit, or store detailed app usage data</li>
        <li>We do not monitor which specific apps you use or how long you use them outside of what is required for the restriction feature</li>
      </ul>

      <hr>

      <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
      <p>Any collected information is used only to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Maintain and improve app performance</li>
        <li>Diagnose bugs or crashes</li>
        <li>Understand general, anonymous usage patterns</li>
        <li>Manage subscriptions and purchase status</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do not use your data for advertising, profiling, or selling to third parties.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>Torah Lock may use trusted third-party services to support core functionality:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Apple App Store — purchases, subscriptions, and analytics</li>
        <li>RevenueCat — subscription management and entitlement status</li>
        <li>Apple Diagnostics — crash and performance reporting</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These services may process limited technical or anonymous data according to their own privacy policies. No personally identifiable information is intentionally transmitted by Torah Lock.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>5. Data Storage</h2>
      <p>Most user data (such as streaks, settings, and session history) is stored locally on your device.</p>
      <p>We do not maintain a user account system, and we do not store personal user profiles on external servers.</p>
      <p>Deleting the app will remove locally stored data from your device.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>Torah Lock is rated 4+ on the App Store. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If you believe that personal data has been unintentionally collected, please contact us and we will take appropriate action.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>7. Your Choices</h2>
      <p>You can limit data sharing by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Disabling analytics and diagnostics sharing in your iOS settings</li>
        <li>Managing Screen Time and Family Controls permissions through iOS</li>
        <li>Canceling subscriptions through your Apple ID settings</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Since no user accounts are created, there is no centralized profile stored by us.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated version will include a new Effective Date. Continued use of the app after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>

      <hr>
