      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p class="legal-date">Effective Date: February 22, 2026</p>

      <p>Welcome to Torah Lock. By downloading or using the app, you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, please do not use the app.</p>

      <h2>1. Use of the App</h2>
      <p>Torah Lock is an iOS application designed to help users begin their day with prayer and spiritual focus before accessing selected apps.</p>
      <p>The app may use Apple's Screen Time API and Family Controls frameworks to temporarily restrict selected applications until the daily morning spiritual session is completed.</p>
      <p>You agree to use Torah Lock only for its intended personal and spiritual use. Any attempt to bypass, manipulate, or interfere with the app's restriction features is prohibited.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>2. Local Data &amp; No Account Requirement</h2>
      <p>Torah Lock does not require you to create an account.</p>
      <p>All personal progress data (such as streaks, preferences, and session history) is stored locally on your device unless otherwise stated. We do not monitor or track your personal device activity outside the app.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>3. Subscriptions &amp; Payments</h2>
      <p>Torah Lock may offer optional paid features through auto-renewable subscriptions.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Payments are processed through Apple's App Store.</li>

      <p>App restrictions are performed locally on your device using Apple's system frameworks.</p>
      <p>Torah Lock does not collect, transmit, or store detailed app usage data on external servers. The restriction functionality is intended solely for personal self-management and focus.</p>
